- Last tested on 1.20.51
- Non experimental
  - This behavior pack uses features to generate a void world and floating islands representing simplified versions of the main biomes
  - Doesn't delete the vanilla structures during generation
  - No custom structure imports in the pack
  - A starter island is generated at x0,z0 and the player is teleported there to begin
  - The starter island is also dynamic based on the biome it generates in
  - Each player that joins will get 1 set of starting gear
- Experimental
  - Same as above, with suppressed biomes to speed up world generation.
